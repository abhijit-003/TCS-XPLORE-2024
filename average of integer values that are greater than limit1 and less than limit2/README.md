Write the `main` method in the `Solution` class.

In the `main` method, read five values for an integer array and two integer values, which are the limits (`limit1` and `limit2`). The `main` method should print the average of integer values that are greater than `limit1` and less than `limit2`.

For example, if the values are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` and the limits are `2` and `6`, then the average is `4` ((3+4+5)/3). The output should be in the format of the sample output.

Note: The returned average value should be of `int` data type.

### Sample Input 1:

1
2
3
4
5
2
6


Output:

4


### Sample Input 2:

100
200
300
400
500
100
500


Output:

300


### Sample Code Snippet for Reference:

Please use the following code to build your solution:

java
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Code to read values
        // Code to display the result
    }
}

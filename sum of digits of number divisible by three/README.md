Write a `main` method in the `Solution` class. In the `main` method, read an integer (containing only numeric digits without decimal and special characters) and check whether the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. 

For example:

- If the given value is `333`, the sum of the digits is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`, which is a multiple of 3. Therefore, the output should be `TRUE`.

- If the given value is `200`, the sum of the digits is `2 + 0 + 0 = 2`, which is not a multiple of 3. Therefore, the output should be `FALSE`.

**Sample Input 1:**  
333

**Output 1:**  
TRUE

**Sample Input 2:**  
200

**Output 2:**  
FALSE

## TCS IPA EXAM 
I recently took the TCS IPA exam, which stands for ION Proctored Assessment. This assessment is conducted to reinforce the knowledge gained through the TCS Xplore program. *(In previous years, the exam results contributed to bonus factors for students, though I'm not certain if that's the case this year.)*

This exam is for student who got TCS offer letter and waiting for joing letter.

The exam is a **100-mark test** with a **2-hour duration**. Below is an overview of the exam structure:

| **Section**                   | **KYT** | **BizSkill** | **UI** | **Unix** | **Java** | **SQL/PLSQL** | **Java Programming** |
|-------------------------------|---------|--------------|--------|----------|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Number of Questions**       | 5       | 5            | 10     | 5        | 15       | 10            |2 (1 question worth 15 marks, 1 worth 35 marks)     |
| **Marks per Section**         | 5       | 5            | 10     | 5        | 15       | 10            | 50 (total for both questions)     |

The exam has two main components:
- **MCQs**: Total 50 marks
- **Coding**: 2 questions totaling 50 marks

### Preparation
To prepare, I practiced Java IPA previous year questions and completed the learning modules provided by TCS Xplore.

**Study Material on TCS Xplore:**
- **MCQ Preparation**: "Java Learning Path 1" (LinkedIn courses), "Technical recording," and "Know Your Organization."
- **Java Coding Preparation**: "Xplore Hands-on" exercises and previous year question papers.

### Exam Strategy
Here’s how I approached the exam:
1. I began with the two Java coding questions, as they require more time for logic building. (You can switch between sections at any time.)
2. Working on the coding questions first can secure 50 marks, but if you get stuck with test cases or logic, don’t spend more than 70 minutes here—move on to the MCQ section.
3. In the MCQ section, I noticed that about 6–7 questions were from previous year questions (PYQs).

**Time Management Tip:** Distribute your time effectively across sections to maximize your score.
